                Vivaann is an student run NGO working primarily in the education field, striving to provide better education for the unprivileged. Vivaann is our attempt to join hands and extend support to the society. This small and humble group of ours is devoted to giving back what the society has given to us. We visualise a mammoth change in the world that we live in. A world where people care and love. A world where each one of us completes each other. Vivaann was founded by a group of college students with a common goal to make a difference. “Vivaann” is the first ray of sunlight that breaks through the darkness into light and that is exactly what our motive is. One notable trend affecting world wide communities is the plight of orphaned and vulnerable children who deserve the attention, love and support of the society. Presently we are helping the orphans of "CHILDREN'S VILLAGE" in their moral and social upliftment.We are trying to evolve and promote skills, creativity and confidence among those children. We not only love to be the cause of smiles on those children’s faces but are also venturing into the slums to help them and make them independent enough so that they can support themselves.
                <br><br>
                Our other plans are women empowerment and providing healthcare to the needy. We hope you find our cause noble enough and support us to make the difference that we all wish to see. So, we call upon the people who want to join hands with us and make a difference in the society. You can either join as a member or volunteer in our causes or you can provide the needy with all the monetary help possible. You can donate or provide your service to the poor and deprived.

					<h2>Pragati</h2>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Pragati is an event conducted in various schools. The process of teaching and learning is continuous and with no boundaries. And the same is taught to children in various interactive sessions where they are motivated to ask, helped to understand amd inspired to grow. We tried to reduce the mosquitoes problem by arranging mosquito net to windows and taught some academic topics using YouTube videos, which actually helped a lot for them to understand easily. The best of part at the end of every pragati session is, we play, dance and review the topics we discussed.</p>

					<h2>Siksha</h2>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Shiksha is an initiative of Vivaann Welfare Association. Under this initiative members and volunteers of Vivaann collect waste paper from door to door and then sell them to recycling companies, the proceeds are then used for providing better education to unprivileged kids and support orphanages. During the first phase, we only collected 489 kilos of paper inside campus and we thought of re-conducting siksha event in the month of December. We collected 3445 kilos of paper along with cardboard material. We used this fund for helping a single mother's son, who wants to study and support his mom financially.</p>

					<h2>Annapurna and Vastradaan</h2>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Realising that about 700 million of the world population go to bed with an empty stomach each night, we started a campaign, Annapurna. It includes the collection of pulses and grains for the needy. Helping people protect themselves against the harsh weather conditions, Vastradaan is an event focusing on collection of clothes for those in need. We collected a handful of rice from houses of East Point Colony, MVP Colony and a few societies near R.K Beach. The collected rice was then distributed to the needy across Vizag.</p>

					<h2>Tripti</h2>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">This is the event where every member gets emotionally attached to the kids of sunflower special school. We played carroms, danced together. We offered them biscuits, chocolates and food for the day. We believe that every member should be part of this event at least once in his Vivaann period.</p>
